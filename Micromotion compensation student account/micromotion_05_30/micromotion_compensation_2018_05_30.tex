\section*{Micromotion compensation}

Context: linear Paul trap, ytterbium. 

\begin{itemize}
\item Is micromotion compensation pretty general or does it vary a lot on trap geometry or ion type? E.g., for Yb, our driving frequency (14.6 MHz) is pretty close to our cooling transition linewidth, so which different micromotion techniques are more applicable or easier for us? 
\item The $P_{1/2}$ linewidth $\gamma = 1/2 \pi \tau$, where $\tau$ is the lifetime of the $P_{1/2}$ level and was measured by Olmschenk to be 8.12 ns. Thus $\gamma = 19.6$ MHz.
\item ...what is the typical unit of natural/atomic lifetimes, radians per second or Hertz?
\item Wineland 1990, referenced in Berkeland 1998: ``the magnitude of the fractional second-order Doppler (time dilation) shift of transition frequencies can be as low as $2 \times 10^{-18}$". What is the fractional second-order Doppler shift? ...
\item ...In any case, due to ion micromotion (as a result of the ac field), the above shift can be many orders of magnitude larger if the average ion position isn't at the ac null.
\end{itemize}


\subsection*{What micromotion is and why it's there}

Following Section II of Berkeland 1998:

\begin{itemize}
\item We apply an ac field to trap our ions in x and y (the electrodes), and a dc field to confine our ions along z (the endcaps).
\item You can calculate the equation of motion of an ion in such a field (the Mathieu equation).
\item Solving the Mathieu equation gives you an expression for an ion's displacement from the trap centre over time. You can separate it into two motions, the \textbf{secular motion} and the \textbf{micromotion}, see equation 8 in Berkeland 1998. 
\item Secular motion is ``typically thermal and incoherent motion" and can be reduced by cooling. This also reduces the amplitude of the micromotion.
\item Micromotion is ``the unavoidable micromotion that occurs when the secular motion carries the ion back and forth through the nodal line of the ac field". So... if zero kinetic energy was possible, the ion could sit exactly at the ac null and it would feel zero force, therefore it would have zero motion. But an ion \textit{always} has a finite temperature, therefore \textit{will} make excursions from the ac null, so will feel the ac fields, resulting in (inevitable) micromotion.
\item If you plot the motion of the ion due to only secular motion and micromotion along one direction, you get a sinusoid with a little ripple on top. Find pic, e.g., Olmschenk's thesis. \textbf{What does excess micromotion do to this picture? Can you reproduce the plot?}
\item The Doppler-cooling limit of the ion temperature \textit{due to secular motion} is the usual Doppler-cooling limit, $T_D = \hbar \gamma / 2 k_B \approx 0.5$ mK for our cooling transition.
\item The above assumes that the dc null and the ac null overlap in space, which is only true for a perfect trap. For an imperfect trap, a difference would result in an extra static electric field felt by the ions (...right?).
\item \textbf{In addition to the trapping fields}, let's say the ion feels another (uniform, static) electric field $\mathbf{E_{dc}}$. This results in a displacement of the average ion position from the ac null to some position $\mathbf{u}_0$. This displacement does not affect the amplitude of the secular motion (and therefore the same can be said for the micromotion amplitude).
\item However, the ac electric field at $\mathbf{u}_0$ causes additional motion. This is termed \textbf{excess micromotion}. 
\end{itemize}

Basically, anything that results in the average ion position not being at the ac null will cause what we dub ``excess micromotion". Such things include:

\begin{itemize}
\item Stray (DC) electric fields often push the ion away from the trap null. 
\item Due to imperfect trap configuration, the rf null may not exactly coincide with the dc null (the dc inwards push from each of the electrodes). This would basically be adding an extra dc field on top.
\item Other effects like phase difference in electrode voltages. How would that manifest in the motion and how would we observe it?  
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{How we observe and minimise micromotion: Doppler velocimetry}

We look at the photon scattering rate of 369 nm light (S$_{1/2}$ to P$_{1/2}$, cooling transition). The linewidth of the transition is approximately 20 MHz.  

Consider micromotion in a single direction. The displacement of the ion is (approximately?) sinusoidal over time, therefore the velocity is also sinusoidal. As the velocity of the ion changes, the ion will ``see" the 369 nm laser shift in frequency due to the Doppler effect. For typical ion speeds of X (corresponding to excursions of Y), the Doppler shift of the 369 nm beam is Z. (Compare this to the linewidth.) (What is the relationship between detuning and scattering rate?) So the scattering rate of photons will vary sinusoidally as the beam shifts on and off resonance, due to the motion of the ion.

\begin{itemize}
\item Typical scattering rates are... X photons per second (ion saturation is an intensity and beam size of Y for 369 nm), and taking into account our solid angle of collection, we expect Z photons to be collected by our PMT per second. (Gulde 2003 scattering rate is 60 MHz and approx 1 in 2000 photons are collected/detected.)
\item Maximum scattering rate of an ion is at $\gamma /2$ (red-detuned), because...
\end{itemize}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l l l} \toprule
& \textbf{Yb 171} & \textbf{Yb 174} \\ \midrule
$S_{1/2} \leftrightarrow P_{1/2}$ & 369.5261 nm & 369.5250 nm \\
 & 739.05220 nm & 739.0500 nm \\  
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Once micromotion has been observed (i.e., an oscillation in the photon scattering rate has been observed on our PMT), we can go about compensation.

% Include some data! Our observed micromotion. Label background and how to calculate contrast.

Stuff not to forget:

\begin{itemize}
\item To compensate along each axis, you need a beam with a component along that axis. Well... to view motion along each axis, you need a beam with a component. As per discussion below, the direction of the stray field is not the same as the direction of the micromotion it results in.

\item If you over-compensate, the phase of the emitted light will flip by 180$^{\circ}$. I.e., the ion is on the ``other side" of the saddle point, so at the same phase of the applied drive field, the ion is now rolling towards the rf null instead of away from it.

\item If you're trapping an ion with multiple 369 beams in different directions, you'll see micromotion along all the directions that the beams have components. These may cancel each other out, which is more obvious from the above statement (that you get a phase flip if you over-compensate). If motion along two directions is of the same magnitude but out of phase, they'll exactly cancel. To check this, see if you still get micromotion if you only cool with one beam (so you'll need to be able to hold the ions with only one beam...).

\item If you have a stray radial field pointing in some direction $\mathbf{e}_s$ will in general cause micromotion in a different direction $\mathbf{e}_m$. E.g., if a stray field pushes an ion along the $x$ axis, it'll undergo micromotion along the $y$ axis \textbf{(get a contour plot to demonstrate this, or figure in Gulde 2003.} So pushing the ion along $x$ will result in motion that is more easily seen by a laser beam propagating along $y$. In general, the effect of a vertical stray field component can be observed with a horizontal laser beam, and corrected by the vertical compensation electrode.

\item You can increase the micromotion amplitude (to make it easier to see? larger signal on top of background?) by decreasing the trap strength/rf drive power.
\end{itemize}


\subsection*{Other methods of micromotion compensation}

For situations where your linewidth is much smaller or much greater than your trap frequency... Etc.

From Gulde 2003 (thesis), here are four methods of micromotion compensation, in order of increasing sensitivity:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Position compensation:} view ion on camera while varying the strength of the rf potential. If compensation is bad (i.e., there are stray dc fields), decreasing the trap strength results in a displacement of the ion. Compensation electrodes are then used to push the ion back to its previous position when the rf strength was highest. \textbf{Draw sketch of different rf strengths to demonstrate.}

\item \textbf{Linewidth compensation:} the width of the $S_{1/2} \leftrightarrow P_{1/2}$ transition is broadened by micromotion sidebands (\textbf{what does that mean?}). To compensate, tune the laser to the red side of the resonance fringe (``by slightly more than half a linewidth")... and optimise the compensation voltages for \textit{minimal} fluorescence. I.e., the compensation voltages make the linewidth more narrow. For this, make sure your (369) laser isn't saturated or you'll get a lot of power broadening. \textbf{This technique might not be suitable for us, compare our linewidth to Gulde's calcium.}

\item \textbf{Correlation compensation:} looking at the photon scattering rate, which is modulated by the drive frequency (what we do). Aha. \textbf{We again need to avoid saturation broadening.}

\item \textbf{Micromotion sideband reduction:} use the $S_{1/2} \leftrightarrow D_{5/2}$ transition (Ca, 729 nm) to resolve motional sidebands... ``including micromotion sidebands at a frequency $\Omega$ (rf frequency) away from the carrier. Minimise the sidebands by tuning the compensation voltages.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
\item What is saturation intensity for our 369 nm?
\end{itemize}


\subsection*{Effects of excess micromotion}

The first-order Doppler shift due to excess micromotion affects your excitation spectrum, even such that a laser frequency that was previously cooling is now heating the ions.

\textbf{Figure 2 of Berkeland 1998:} two cases, a) rf drive/linewidth = 0.1, and b) rf drive/linedwith = 10. For us, rf drive/linewidth $\approx$ 1.
